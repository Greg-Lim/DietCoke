In another context, two horses are shown pulling a plow; again, horses are the typical choice for providing the pulling power to plow a field.

In a group scene where multiple horses are being led, it's likely that they're being used for labor, rather than simply being kept as pets or companions. In another context, a man is depicted plowing while being carried by three horses; this, too, suggests agricultural labor, as the purpose of the additional horses may be to provide extra power or stability as the man works.

The context does not provide enough information to determine where the baseball players are running specifically, so answers such as \"home base\" or \"third base\" are speculative.
